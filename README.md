# Card Zero
## By Desmond Milani
The point of this game is to lose all the cards

## Gameplay
The game begins with a shuffled deck placed face down, known as the closed deck. Players take turns drawing a card from the closed deck and placing it face up on the open deck. The twist lies in matching shapes rather than numbers or suits. If the drawn card's shape corresponds to the top card on the open deck, the player claims all cards in the open deck.

As the closed deck dwindles, players seamlessly transition to playing cards from their hands, further complicating the game dynamics. The ultimate goal is to be the first to play all their cards, earning the coveted title of CardZero champion.

Embark on the CardZero journey, where the quest to lose all cards becomes a thrilling adventure in strategy, luck, and the pursuit of victory.
